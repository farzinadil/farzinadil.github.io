- **EV Supply Chain Readiness:** Highlight GM’s big EV ramp-up and battery supply investments (e.g. Lithium Americas deal and cathode material contracts)[news.gm.com](https://news.gm.com/home.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jan/0131-lithium.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGM%20has%20secured%20all%20the,%E2%80%9D)[supplychaindive.com](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/general-motors-supply-chain-visibility-optilogic-sku/720444/#:~:text=GM%20has%20worked%20to%20improve,intended%20for%20EV%20battery%20production). *“How is GPSC gearing up to support the EV transition? For example, what role does your team play in integrating new suppliers for batteries and motors to ensure we can meet GM’s EV production targets?”*
- **Supply Chain Resilience Post-Crisis:** Note GM’s response to recent disruptions – standardizing chips and using scenario modeling[resilinc.ai](https://resilinc.ai/blog/automakers-gain-more-control-over-their-semiconductor-supply-chains-with-new-sourcing-strategies/#:~:text=GM%20announced%20that%20it%20is,partners%2C%20according%20to%20Automotive%20News)[supplychaindive.com](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/general-motors-supply-chain-visibility-optilogic-sku/720444/#:~:text=General%20Motors%20aims%20to%20use,a%20June%2025%20press%20release). *“After the chip shortage, what long-term changes has GM made in supply chain strategy? I’m curious if GPSC now keeps critical component safety stocks or works directly with chip makers to avoid future shortages.”* This shows you’re aware of lessons learned and interested in the company’s adaptive strategies.
- **Digital Innovation and Data:** Mention GM’s use of advanced tools and OnStar data for logistics visibility[automotivelogistics.media](https://www.automotivelogistics.media/digital-technology/validating-supply-chain-data-to-improve-decision-making/43517.article#:~:text=GM%20is%20also%20working%20with,with%20GM%E2%80%99s%20OnStar%20GPS%20technology). *“I love that GM uses its OnStar technology to track parts in transit – that’s a clever integration of product tech into operations. Are there other ways your team is using data analytics or AI to optimize supply chain decisions (like demand forecasting or routing)?”* This can segue into a discussion on any in-house systems or algorithms they use.
- **Sustainability and ESG Goals:** Acknowledge GM’s push for a greener supply chain (supplier carbon neutrality pledge, renewable energy, etc.)[supplychaindigital.com](https://supplychaindigital.com/articles/how-is-gm-integrating-sustainability-into-its-supply-chain#:~:text=Through%20a%20policy%20of%C2%A0%20active,ambitious%20goals%20and%20aggressive%20timelines)[supplychaindigital.com](https://supplychaindigital.com/articles/how-is-gm-integrating-sustainability-into-its-supply-chain#:~:text=The%20company%20also%20uses%20technology,affecting%20the%20supply%20chain%20members). *“GM has bold sustainability goals. How does GPSC ensure suppliers are meeting environmental and ethical standards? Do you see sustainability metrics affecting supplier selection or development in your projects?”* This question connects big-picture values to daily operations, a point an interviewer would appreciate.
- **Strategic Supplier Collaboration:** Bring up the importance of supplier partnerships in innovation and problem-solving[theautomotiveleaderspodcast.com](https://theautomotiveleaderspodcast.com/episode/automotive-supplier-relationships-with-steve-kiefer-and-dave-andrea#:~:text=,the%20purchasing%20organization%2C%E2%80%9D%20Dave%20says). *“How does the GPSC team collaborate with suppliers and other departments on new initiatives? For example, if there’s a cost challenge or a need to localize a component, how do you work with the supplier and engineering to address it?”* This invites the interviewer to talk about cross-functional teamwork and also lets you subtly show you understand the value of good supplier relationships.

- **Digital-twin stack**
    
    *“I read that GPSC is using Optilogic’s Cosmic Frog for network simulations. Under the hood, are you containerising the modelling services on Kubernetes and feeding them real-time data through Kafka or something else? I’m curious how you orchestrate large-scale ‘what-if’ runs without crushing cost or latency.”*
    
- **IoT & telematics integration**
    
    *“GM already taps OnStar telemetry to track vehicles in transit. Are inbound-parts control-tower dashboards powered by the same data stream—say via Azure IoT Hub or AWS IoT Core—and how do you handle the event-stream back-pressure when thousands of pallets start chirping at once?”*
    
- **Standardised micro-controller families**
    
    *“With the new three-family chip strategy covering 95 % of ECU needs, is GPSC coordinating a common software abstraction layer—perhaps AUTOSAR Adaptive or an in-house micro-services pattern—to keep firmware teams from rewriting for every silicon spin? How do you see that influencing the future cloud build pipeline?”*
