          <p>I was issued a traffic citation and decided to go to court with ChatGPT and Google Bard as my legal counsel. Here’s what happened.</p>
        </br>
        <img src="../public/img/court.jpg" alt="Article description">
        </br>
          <p>I recently bought a car in California and was issued a Temporary Operating Permit (TOP). I was driving this car on the other side of the country in Pennsylvania when I got pulled over. The officer issued a citation of Pennsylvania's statute 75 § 7124: Fraudulent use or removal of registration plate.  He didn’t believe the California TOP was valid or legitimate. 
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            Facing a $243.15 fine, I could have easily settled it by paying off the amount, dodging a court appearance, and moving past the issue. Instead, I opted to declare myself not guilty and take the matter to court, encouraged by my confidence in leveraging AI for legal counsel in this scenario. Without generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard, I would have conceded and paid the fine, as hiring an attorney for a $243.15 fine wouldn't be financially sensible, nor would conducting the necessary legal research myself seem a worthwhile investment of time. AI, however, shifted the equation. Upon presenting the details of the incident and the charges to both ChatGPT and Google Bard, they concurred that I had not violated any laws.
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
            This is the defense that Google Bard drafted:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="custom-style">
            <p>Your Honor,</p>
          </br>
            <p>I am here today to contest the charge of fraudulent use/removal of registration plate under PA statute 75 § 7124. I was driving my car with a valid California Temporary Operating Permit (TOP) when I was pulled over by the police. The officer claimed that my TOP was not a valid registration plate, and that I was therefore in violation of the law.</p>
          </br>
            <p>I respectfully disagree with the officer's interpretation of the law. A TOP is a valid registration plate, and it is not affixed to a vehicle with the intent to conceal or misrepresent the identity of the vehicle or its owner. In fact, the California DMV specifically states that a TOP can be used to operate a vehicle on public roads in Pennsylvania.</p>
          </br>
            <p>To support my argument, I would like to present the following evidence:</p>
          </br>
            <ul>
              <li>— A copy of my valid California TOP.</li>
              <li>— Proof of payment of all registration fees.</li>
              <li>— Proof of insurance.</li>
            </ul>
          </br>
          <p>I would also like to clarify that I was in compliance with the requirements set forth by the California DMV for the display and use of the TOP. I displayed the TOP on my vehicle in the same manner as a license plate, and I was not attempting to conceal or misrepresent the identity of the vehicle or its owner.</p>
        </br>
        <p>I would like to emphasize that I had no intent to commit fraud or misrepresent the identity of my vehicle. I was merely using the TOP in accordance with California law and had no intention of violating Pennsylvania law.</p>
      </br>
      <p>Based on the evidence presented and the lack of fraudulent intent, I kindly request that the traffic court dismiss the citation issued under PA statute 75 § 7124.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Thank you for your time.</p>

          Armed with the defense crafted by AI, I confidently entered the courthouse, ready to challenge the traffic citation I had received. Dressed appropriately like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Md8zaYEL5c" target="_blank" class="custom-link">my cousin Vinny</a> and feeling assured of my position, I was prepared to present my case. Before the hearing, I encountered the issuing officer in the waiting area. We discussed the situation briefly, and he asked me to show him the valid registration along with other documents.        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          After reviewing the documents, the officer realized that pursuing the case might be futile and he decided to drop the case. This outcome, while unexpected, made me feel vindicated and demonstrated the utility of AI.        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          The experience affirmed the value of AI in providing legal guidance. Despite my lack of legal knowledge, the advice from ChatGPT and Google Bard gave me the confidence to contest the citation effectively.         </p>
        </br>
        <p>
          However, it is important to exercise caution as there is a case of AI citing incorrect information in a court case. While there are certainly some issues that need to be resolved, I see tremendous potential in using AI for low-cost legal assistance.
