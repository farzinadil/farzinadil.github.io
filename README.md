## About the Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, [farzinadil.com](https://farzinadil.com). It’s a simple, fast, **static site** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) — no build step required.

## About Me

I’m a Software Engineer with hands‑on experience across the stack:

- **Java** — high‑availability, mission‑critical applications  
- **React** — intuitive, performant front‑end features  
- **Node.js & TypeScript** — RESTful APIs and services  
- **Python** — automation and data processing

I’m currently working on the **Car Price History Tool** (repo: https://github.com/farzinadil/car-price-history-tool), which includes components like **FlyingCarz.io** (see the Projects page). I’m also expanding my knowledge in **AWS** and **React**.

Outside of engineering, I train Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai/Kickboxing, and wrestling.

## Getting Started (Local)

### Easiest: Open the file directly
- Double‑click `index.html` (or open it via your browser’s **File → Open**).

### Optional: Run a lightweight local server
This can help with relative paths, SPA routing, or CORS in some browsers.

**Python 3**
    
    python3 -m http.server 5500
    # open http://localhost:5500

**Node (npx)**
    
    npx serve .

**VS Code (Live Server extension)**
- Install “Live Server”
- Right‑click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**

---

## Deployment

- **GitHub Pages:**  
  Settings → Pages → “Deploy from a branch” (e.g., `main`, root).  
  (Add a `.nojekyll` file only if needed; not required for plain HTML/CSS/JS.)

- **Netlify / Vercel:**  
  Point to the repo root and deploy as a static site.
